# Data Structures and Algorithms notes
This repository have my review notes for data structures and algorithms.

The notes are separated in two folders,
* Data Structures
* Algorithms

Where each folder will contain the definitions, time-space complexity, use-cases, and relevant problems using them.

## Motivation
It's been a few years since I took my Data Structures and Algorithms classes, so I decided it was time to review and strengthen my knowledge in these concepts. Moreover, these concepts are extremely important in any coding career, so centralizing my notes in an organized matter will be useful in the future if I ever need to review something again.
